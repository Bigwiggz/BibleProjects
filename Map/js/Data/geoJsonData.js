The statement that the garden was “in Eden, toward the east,” apparently indicates that the garden occupied only a portion of the region called Eden. (Ge 2:8) However, the garden is thereafter called “the garden of Eden” (Ge 2:15) and, in later texts, is spoken of as “Eden, the garden of God” (Eze 28:13), and as “the garden of Jehovah.”​—Isa 51:3.  The Septuagint rendered the Hebrew word for “garden” (gan) by the Greek word pa·raʹdei·sos. To this fact we owe our association of the English word “paradise” with the garden of Eden.",

As such, Nineveh was a “city of bloodshed” (Na 3:1), for the Assyrians waged many wars of conquest and employed brutal methods in killing captured warriors. Doubtless the military campaigns contributed greatly to the city’s wealth. (Na 2:9) The principal deity of Nineveh appears to have been Ishtar, a goddess of love and war.",

The surrounding area today is quite barren, consisting of a stony plateau with sparse vegetation. Yet the existence of several springs there shows that the ancient city had an excellent water supply.  Bethel’s position was strategic and contributed greatly to its importance. Situated on the backbone of the central mountain range, it was on the important N-S route that followed the watershed line, running all the way from Shechem southward through Bethel, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and down to Beer-sheba.",

Neʹghev also came to mean “south” and is used with reference to a southern side (Nu 35:5), a southern boundary (Jos 15:4), and a southern gate (Eze 46:9). In some translations a distinction between the geographic designation and the compass direction is not maintained, resulting in confusing renderings. An example of this is Genesis 13:1, where translating neʹghev as “south” (AS, KJ, Le) makes it appear that Abraham went southward out of Egypt, when actually his direction was northward through the Negeb to Bethel. But this difficulty has been eliminated in many modern translations.",

        "description": "An ancient and important city of Syria. Damascus (present-day esh-Sham, or Dimashq) lies at the foot of the Anti-Lebanon Range, with the nearby Arabian-Syrian Desert stretching out before it to the E. (Ca 7:4) To the SW of the city, snowcapped Mount Hermon rises 2,814 m (9,232 ft), marking the southern end of the Anti-Lebanon Range.  The slopes behind Damascus to the W are quite barren, but the cool waters of the Barada River (the Abanah of 2Ki 5:12) come rushing through a gorge in the mountains and flow onto the plain where the city is situated. Thereafter irrigation creates a luxuriant oasis some 16 km (10 mi) wide and 48 km (30 mi) long. This abundant water supply made Damascus a key point on the ancient military and trade routes between the lands of the eastern Mediterranean, the countries of Mesopotamia, and the Orient. Also serving to channel traffic by Damascus are the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, since these act as a natural barrier to caravan traffic moving toward or from the Mediterranean seaboard.",

(Ps 60:6; 108:7; PICTURE, Vol. 1, p. 530) Situated at the E end of the narrow valley running between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, Tell Balata lies about 48 km (30 mi) N of Jerusalem. A good supply of water is available, and just E of the site there is a fertile plain. Anciently Shechem commanded the E-W and N-S roads traversing central Palestine. (Compare Jg 21:19.) Lacking the military advantage of being built on a mountain, the city depended on its fortifications for security.​—Jg 9:35.  When Abram (Abraham) first entered the Promised Land, he traveled as far as “the site of Shechem” and encamped near the big trees of Moreh, where he later built an altar. (Ge 12:6-9) Nearly two centuries afterward Jacob, upon returning from Paddan-aram, pitched camp in front of Shechem and purchased some land there. In reaction to their sister Dinah’s being violated by Shechem the son of Hamor, the sons of Jacob​—Simeon and Levi—​killed the men of the city. ",
